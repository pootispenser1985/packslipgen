#packslipgen

This repo holds a simple web application that renders a printable packing slip based on the PO number you give it. All the order information is stored in a table called Orders, and retrieved with SQL.
It does work, but since all the data I used in the creation of it is actual order data from the company I work for at my normal day job, I can't demonstrate it. I'm including this program as part of my 
portfolio, but the actual data that lives in the table is confidential. Eventually I'll make up a fake database to go with it.
