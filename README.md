#packslipgen

This repo holds a simple web application that renders a printable packing slip based on the PO 
number you give it. All the order information is stored in a table and retrieved 
with SQL. I'm including this program as part of my portfolio, but the actual data that lives in 
the table is confidential, so eventually I'll make up a fake database to go with it. It works
but I can't demonstrate it until I do.
